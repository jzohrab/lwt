/*
A helper script to find bad data.

LWT would sometimes create multiword expressions, but not put them in
the "right place" in textitems2, or would not update textitems2
Ti2Text and Ti2TextLC correctly.

For example, suppose we had the following textitems2 data:

| Ti2Text    | Ti2WordCount | Ti2Order |
| un gato    | 2            | 14       |
| Yo         | 1            | 14       |
|            | 0            | 15       |
| tengo      | 1            | 16       |

This data is "bad" because the multiword expression "un gato" has been
put in position Ti2Order 14, but the actual parsed text had "Yo, ,
tengo" for those positions.  When the text is rendered, "un gato"
would hide the words "Yo", " ", "tengo", and the text wouldn't make
sense.

This query is slow and so should not be run on the browser -- it's a
back-end data cleanup job, that should be run as a separate command.

-- all data
-- select * from textitems2 order by ti2txid, ti2order, ti2wordcount desc;

-- Check single-word terms mapped ok.
-- select * from textitems2 where ti2woid != 0 and (ti2text is null or ti2text = '') and ti2wordcount = 1;

-- Check multiwords -- sometimes the text is null!
-- select * from textitems2 where ti2woid != 0 and (ti2text is null or ti2text = '') and ti2wordcount > 1;

-- Heavy query to compare the multi-word-terms with the mword that
-- _would_ be created if we just joined the parse textitem2 entries in
-- the same range.

-- This query doesn't fix anything, but it could be used to do a fix.
