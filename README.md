# Learning with Texts

This is a fork of [Hugo Fara's fork](https://github.com/hugofara) of the original Learning with Texts project on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts).

## Introductory links:

* Project overview: See [old readme](./docs/old_README.md), or the README on Hugo's fork
* [Why this is forked](./docs/why_the_fork.md)

## Major differences with Hugo Fara's repo

* Wordpress logins give new users their own separate LWT database instance.  See [docs.wordpress](./docs/wordpress.md) for notes.

## Installation, usage, etc.

Most of the docs at https://github.com/hugofara are still valid.  If anything changes vastly in this fork, I'll briefly document it, and will add detail if requested.

For installation from this fork, `git clone` this repo and use the master branch.


## Branches

* **master**: the main branch I use for my own LWT work.
* other branches: features I'm working on.
